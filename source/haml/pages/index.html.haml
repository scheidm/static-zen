%h1 Greetings visitor!

%p
  My name is Mark Scheid, a programmer hailing from Northboro, MA. I have a 
  passion for creation, whether it be a new web application, a piece of fiction, a
  community event, or the perfect music playlist. My passion lies in the
  possibilities unlocked by modern web technologies, and I love learning new tools
  and applying them to solving interesting problems. I created this website to
  showcase my work, in the hopes of finding like-minded people to collaborate
  with.

      Ruby has been my primary production language since April 2013. I love the freedom of expression Ruby gives you, and the quality of the libraries available on 
      %a(href='https://rubygems.org/') Rubygems.
      I likewise have had a lot of opportunity to use Python, both for all those 1-off command line tools you end up needing, and for academic work.
    %p
      Since September 2013, the vast majority of my time has been going towards a web application called 
      %a(href = 'https://github.com/scheidm/quest-till-done')Quest Till Done.
      Built on Rails, it's a very visual productivity tool, and so most of our interface has been JavaScript heavy. For the last few months, I've been experimenting with Javascript frameworks as we begin to migrate the whole project to an AJAX approach.
    %p
      Most of my academic programming in the last few years has been Java, so I remain very comfortable with that language. My first formal code education was in C++, and I remain comfortable enough that I can drop some C extensions into my code when necessary.
    %p
      This past fall I took a Web Developer position at 
      %a(href='http://www.liquidpixels.com/')LiquidPixels.
      I've since been working hard on developing a new central architecture for their various client facing tools and services. This new project has me up to my elbows in Perl, Javascript, and SQL on a daily basis, and I'm expanding my developers toolbelt daily
    %p
      My next target will likely be
      %a( href='http://clojure.org/' ) Clojure
      as I've been meaning to do some serious functional programming to provide a counterpoint to a formal education that largely focused on the virtues of the Object-Oriented paradigm.
      I'm still looking for the right project to really leverage the multi-threaded performance benefits of the language before diving in, and in the meantime I have plenty of other
      %a( href='projects') projects on my plate.

    %p 
      While I was always attracted to Vim for the speed of expression and wealth of plugins, the proliferation of free or inexpensive server
      options has made this command line tool even more valuable. It is the standard by which I judge other programs in my dev environment. Once I found
      %a(href = 'https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim')Vundle 
      and could host my whole setup on a GitHub repository, bridging my configuration between computers has been a breeze
    %p
      I still remain loyal to Bash, and 
      %a(href = 'https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator')Tmux
      has made managing multiple sessions so much simpler and more powerful than the old days with
      Screen. Vim-like bindings make the tool instantly comfortable, and make quick work of checking on server errors in my latest web-app.
    %p
      As I often found myself working in Windows environments, I have become passionate about virtualization tools. Since 2013, I have used 
      %a(href = 'https://www.vagrantup.com/')Vagrant boxes 
      with Virtual Box and VMware Fusion to run a customized Ubuntu environment from within Mac and Windows machines. I've found that modern computers have plenty of overhead
      to support multiple simultaneous virtual machines, and the having consistency of image between development and deployment helps alleviate some common developer headaches.
      It is an exciting time in computing, and in the coming year I'm looking forward to taking the next step and migrating my tools to take advantage of tools like
      %a(href = 'https://www.docker.com/') Docker
      to eke further performance out of my virtualized environments.

      I've completed 2 degrees at Drexel University, giving me a rather
      unique perspective on the world. My first degree was in International
      Area Studies, which gave me a solid foundation in Mandarin Chinese,
      Eastern philosophy, and Anthropology. My second degree in Computer
      Science laid the foundation for my professional career, and earned me
      domain knowledge of Object Oriented design patterns, data structures
      and algorithms, and Unix systems.

    While english is my mother tongue, I enjoy studying other languages. I have dabbled in Spanish since classes in high-school, and aim to improve if for no other reason than a desire to travel to places like Argentina and Peru. 
  %p I took up Chinese in college, pursuing an interest in Eastern philosophy and Chinese culture. I spent 4 months living in Nanjing as part of study abroad program, exploring the country and studying the original text of the Dao De Jing. The Chinese people were very welcoming and supportive, and I hope to get the chance to return in the future.
